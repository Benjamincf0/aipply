The application that automates all your job applications with a press of a button.

## How it works
Create a profile containing all pertinent information about yourself. Then, the user may search up jobs through an API, filtering my role name, type and location, and then apply to any of them. After applying to an job application, the profile information is then going to be used by the stagehand agent and a browserbase session which will autofill all fields of the application, completing it on its own. You simply let it do its thing!
